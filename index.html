    Dear Jillzuuuuuuu, 
Many many happy returns of the day! May you have a wonderful day and beautiful year ahead, filled with lots and lots of love, good health and prosperity. 
I cannot even begin to tell you how much I missed you at work. Have such wonderful memories of working together...from sharing tiffins to our bathroom gossip sessions to goofing up at work and being shit scared that we'd be asked to leave :p 
It's been such a great experience. You're such a caring and loving person and I really wish you start giving youself more credit for being this fabulous. 
I hope this year makes you start believing in yourself and how much you're truly worth (immeasurable). You tend to doubt yourself a bit too often! It's truly a waste of your time because I know how smart and talented you are and if you let yourself lose, you've got endless opportunities ahead of you. 
I know that the past couple of months have been a rollercoaster in terms of emotions but I know that you'll fight your way through this. You're gonna emerge a stronger and more confident girl. I believe in you. 
You're a gem of a person and I absolutely love you for your candid self. 
I miss having you around. Hope to see you super soon and give you a bear HUGG!  And of course, let's not forget the much over due catch up on cribbing/ commnting about almost everyone around us, need to buy formals and all the junk food! 
May this year be the turning point in your life and bring you nothing but positivity. I love you, Jillzuuuuuuu ðŸ˜˜ Happy Happy Birthday!
        -Loads of love....Fauzuu

    Happy Birthday Jillu! I know I don't tell you this more often but I love you way too much and you are very special to me in every way.
        I still remember the night stays and our never ending conversations, night outs and dancing all night long, our lunch dates, canteen coffee and gossip sessions, Colaba shopping spree, Lawtryst masti and Annual day preparations and many more memories. 
        I wish I could relive all of them with you. 
        Mumbai wouldn't have been the same without you Jillu!
        Wishing you loads of happiness cause you deserve it baby. I wish you a day filled with laughter and giggles, small pleasures and love. I wish you a day when all your dreams come true and a year that means the most to you. May almighty shower all his blessings upon you and fill your life with positivity and love.  
        I love you itna, you never think kitna! 
        Happy Birthday sweetheart! I hope to see you super soon. 
        -Loads of love....Anshuu
